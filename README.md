To create admin account you need to access install.php via URL only
You should create an email instead of userName Khoa@admin would work
To make the system run, you need to delete the install.php file manualy
//login Section
To login either your normal account or login admin account, PLS access MyAccount-Login.php
In register section, it asks for password, In case the condition is hard you could use, Bre@k0ut as your password.
//Home Mall
We use different photo to demonstrate our products and shops because it was boring looking at the same picture.
You may notice new products are not in time order, but they are selected as the most 10 recent products.
When you are logged and  press "order now" in a product page, you will be redirect the order page with no display when there are nothing in your cart. We want to address this issue but we temporarily cant because the adding features was developed using javascript.

The index.php may not work properly since it is a duplicate version of Home.php to address a requirement. So you should access Home.php first.

Recommendation section in product pages works using random number generator.

In this assignment, we have added new features:
-Horizontal carousel in home page:
it would automatically run on laptop and tablet screen size.
however, on phone, the scroll stops and instead users can clicks on left or right button to navigate the carousel.
-modal window in about us
-condition checker in contact, login and information pages
-log in status to check if user has logged in or not
-shopping, adding products to cart, remove products from cart.

In the last assignment, we are told to name homepage as index.html but we didn't notice that requirement till we completed the website. Any actions of changing the name files would cost us to do more changes on other pages and would cost a lot of time, therefore, we did not do it. However, we came to a solution this time, which is to duplicate the home pages and rename it as index.html. This requires us to do repairing links on the this page only. But we believe it would cause glitches.

Our website is a shopping mall webpages, there are three stores which we created by ourselves, Book world, Out sneaking and Trapicality. However, you may only see one store as we only created the interface for one store.

The second issue you may find in our website is there are lots of products pages. It was due to our misunderstanding that we thought we need to create 3 stores webpages and all products pages for each. However, we realised we were wrong after reading your message. As a result we did not build any stores or product pages afterward but we did not delete the created product pages, because it is our work contribution and deleting these pages may cause issues with an imbalance between our contribution.

You may have questions on our group members, there are 4 people in the group but there are only 3 members in about us pages. We started our website with 3 members without knowing that we got an auto signed member and the week before deadline he messaged us, and that was when we realised there are 4 people in the group. We couldn't contact him untill this wednesday( Apr,14,2021) so we assigned him work and continue but the next day he refused the work and said he would withdrew from this semester. Therefore, there are only 3 members participated in the asignment, the one in About Us. Here is the information of the student that withdrew, Benjamin George- s3740923.

The majority of the images used in this website is our original content or in other words these images are captured or digitally hand drawn by Khoa, a member. Therefore we will not provide any citation and reference for these contents.
