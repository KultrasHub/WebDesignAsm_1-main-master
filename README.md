Our website is a shopping mall webpages, there are three stores which we created by ourselves, Book world, Out sneaking and Trapicality. However, you may only see one store as we only created the interface for one store. 

The second issue you may find in our website is there are lots of products pages. It was due to our misunderstanding that we thought we need to create 3 stores webpages and all products pages for each. However, we realised we were wrong after reading your message. As a result we did not build any stores or product pages afterward but we did not delete the created product pages, because it is our work contribution and deleting these pages may cause issues with an imbalance between our contribution.

You have questions on our group members, there are 4 people in the group but there are only 3 members in about us pages. We started our website with 3 members without knowing that we got an auto signed member and the week before deadline he messaged us, and that was when we realised there are 4 people in the group. We couldn't contact him untill this wednesday( Apr,14,2021) so we assigned him work and continue but the next day he refused the work and said he would withdrew from this semester. Therefore, there are only 3 members participated in the asignment, the one in About Us. Here is the information of the student that withdrew, Benjamin George- s3740923.

The majority of the images used in this website is our original content or in other words these images are captured or digitally hand drawn by Khoa, a member. Therefore we will not provide any citation and reference for these contents.
